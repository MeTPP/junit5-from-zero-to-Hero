What is Junit5?
Junit 5 = JUnit Platform + JUnit Jupiter + JUnit Vintage.


JUnit Platform - foundation for launching testing frameworks on the JVM.

JUnit Jupiter - the most interesting part for us. It is combination of the programming and extension model for writing tests and extensions in JUnit5.

JUnit Vintage - tool for running JUnit3 and JUnit4 based test on the platform. (it helped companies with huge test code bases written in old style test to update framework seamlessly)
